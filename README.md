## Python - Selenium practice repository

Hello

This is my Python + Selenium practice repository.

I'm testing E-commerce shop: http://automationpractice.com/index.php

At current state following tests are available:

- Search
- Subscribe to newsletter
- Forgotten password
- Contact Us form
- Login
- Change personal data (name etc.)
- Change password
- Add product to wishlist
- Create new account
- Add new address to an existing account
- Add to basket
- Checkout -> Pay By Wire
- Checkout -> Pay By Check

All can be run locally via. test_suite.sh -> it runs all tests in consecutive order, after one is finished then next is ran.
Checkout tests aren't included at current state of Test Suite, as I don't want to spam test site with orders.
